This is a new version of my blog, hosted on [GitHub][github] and powered by [Jekyll][jekyll].

Although I thought I would have to start from scratch, fortunately I was able to retrieve all my old posts. Some things might not look right though (the contents come from an Wordpress-to-Jekyll export-script). In case you find anything funny, please report it as an [issue][issues]. I'm still cleaning things up and will try to have (Disqus) comments re-enabled.

One of the reasons I was not writing articles more often (apart from my awesome procrastination skills) is that I was fairly sure to be moving my blog to some other platform. Now that it finally happened, articles should roll in more often.

Stay tuned.
