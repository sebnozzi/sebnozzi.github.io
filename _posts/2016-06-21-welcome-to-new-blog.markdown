This is a new version of my past blog. I'm basically starting from scratch.

Through this blog I will make my first experiences using [Jekyll][jekyll] and publishing on [GitHub][github].

Hopefully this will mean that I will write articles more often.

What can you expect?

* Scala-related articles
* Articles about software design

Stay tuned.
